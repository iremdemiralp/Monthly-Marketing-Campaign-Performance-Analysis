## SQL Analysis Projects 

This repository contains SQL analysis scripts created using DBeaver. Each file includes queries tailored to specific business needs or data analysis scenarios.

### Project Overview
This project is a monthly-level marketing performance analysis across campaigns from Facebook Ads and Google Ads. The focus is on identifying performance trends over time and providing actionable insights for long-term strategy development.

### Key Objectives
Monthly Aggregation: Grouped data by month and campaign using DATE_TRUNC() for trend analysis.

Performance Indicators: Calculated monthly CTR, CPC, CPM, and ROMI.

Trend Comparison: Used window functions (e.g., LAG()) to track percentage change over time in key KPIs.

Data Validation: Ensured accurate monthly summaries by handling missing and zero-value cases.

Strategic Insight: Created a clear and concise dataset to evaluate campaign performance across months.

###  Objective
The aim of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in SQL and data analysis, showcasing how I handle real-world data scenarios.

###  Tools Used
- DBeaver CE  
- PostgreSQL (or your database of choice)  
- SQL (Structured Query Language)
